Types of recursion:

Tail recursion:
If the recursive function is calling itself and that call is a lat call 
statement then it is called tail recursion. refer(recusrion.c). Loop is 
more efficient when compared to tail recursion.

Head recursion:
the first statement inside the function is a recursive call and no
statement before the function call. eg No processing at the time of
calling, all processing done at the time of returning.

eg
void func()
{
	if (n > 0)
	func(n-1);
	xxxxx;
	xxxxx;
	xxxxx;
	xxxxx;
}

tree recursion:
Function calling itself multiple times.\
refer example tree_recursion.c

indirect recurision:
functionA->functionB->fuctionA
refer indirect_recursion.c

Nested recursion:
a recurisve call taking recursive call as parameter. 
recursive inside recursive function
